## Synopsis
This is a school project that I made. It's a module that everyone can use. You can use it to implement snappy comments into your project. Or if you dont want snappy comments you can change them into nice compliments or something that fits your project.

## Code Example
If you want the files you can download the zip. If you just want to look at the code, you can do this online. Open this link and you can even edit the contents: https://jsfiddle.net/scottie7/zsgxks17/


## Motivation
I made this module because I thought it was funny. I always like moments from characters in movies, books or something else that gives a snappy comment about something at an unexpected moment. I'm also thinking of using something similar to this module on my portfolio website in the form of qualities I have or something like that.

## Installation
If you want the files you can download the zip. If you just want to look at the code, you can do this online. Open this link and you can even edit the contents: https://jsfiddle.net/scottie7/zsgxks17/


## Tests
I made a jsfiddle, so you can take a look at the code and if you want to you could change it and save it for your own use.

The module is not complete because it has to be changed on the inside rather than be called upon with parameters from outside the module like a module should do. Im working on this.
